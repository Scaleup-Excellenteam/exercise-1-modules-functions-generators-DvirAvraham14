This repository contains four functions in Python:

find_deep_files(): a function that returns a list of files in a folder that start with the letters "deep".

join(): a function that takes an unlimited number of lists and returns a single list that consists of all the lists joined together. An optional separator string can be specified to be inserted between the lists.

interleave(): a function that takes one or more iterable parameters and returns a list of interleaved members. The members from the iterables are combined into a single list in an alternating fashion.

extract_secret_messages(): a function that extracts secret messages from a binary file. The messages are strings of at least 5 lowercase English letters, followed by an exclamation point.
